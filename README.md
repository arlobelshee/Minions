# Minions

The language you use to conquer the world.

Become an Evil Overlord. Bend cities to your will. Watch from your throne as your minions accomplish your goals.

## Conquest-Driven Development

Here are some of the terms of art:

* **City**: A potentially-productive resource waiting for some Overlord to conquer it and make it productive. Some people call these "virtual machines." Cities can be deployed anywhere and the exposed to the internet for conquest. Cities come and go as needed. Every City is filled with an infinite number of Fools. Buildings may be constructed or blown up within Cities.
* **Productive City**: A city that has been put to use by an Overlord. An Overlord has deployed a Master Plan for the City, turning all of its Fools into Minions. It now does useful work. Most productive cities do work via messages. They receive messages from other cities, do work, and then send messages out to other cities.
* **Fool**: A being that could potentially do useful work. Each city has an infinite supply of Fools.
* **Minion**: A Fool that has been given a Mission Briefing. It now does useful work on behalf of its Overlord (performs a Mission). Minions will always be killed when their Mission is done (whether they succeed or not). Minions are unable to see any other Minions. They communicate only via Secret Messages. Minions are lazy: they don't do anything until a Secret Message triggers some phase of their Mission. Then they do whatever instructions were included in their Mission Briefing for that phase.
* **Device**: A tool for Minions to use. It does nothing on its own. But it can be easily deployed to any City as part of a Master Plan. Devices may require one or multiple Minions to be useful.
* * **Mission**: One part of a Master Plan. Carried out by a single Minion. A Mission is a set of phases. Each phase is triggered by receipt of a specific Secret Message and contains a set of instructions for the Minion to carry out. Many Missions involve acquiring or manipulating Loot.
* **Mission Briefing**: A description of a Mission. Can be given to any number of Fools at any time to turn them into Minions on that Mission. Describes the phases, Buildings, Devices, and Secret Messages involved in this Mission.
* **Master Plan**: Several Mission Briefings, Devices, and smaller Master Plans that can be used together to attain some purpose. A Master Plan may be deployed to a City to make that City Productive.
* **Building**: A place to hold stuff, get mail (Secret Messages), and perform Missions.
* **Loot**: Some thing that your Minions use in their Missions. Each item of Loot is always found in exactly one Building. Loot may be created, moved, destroyed, modified, or forged (copied), but it cannot exist in multiple places at once. Minions spend most of their time interacting with Loot.
