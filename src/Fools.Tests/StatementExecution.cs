			// VM model consists of code chunks, triggers for those code chunks, one stack per code chunk, and universes. Universes can come
			// from locals, or from other sources. Eg, might create a "Session" universe for a particular HTTP request/response and its associated
			// TCP stuff. Thus, user-level code can create shared universes, but there are compiler-generated ones for things like locals.
			//
			// A universe can be constructed with pre-allocated variables (compiler knows that it'll need 2 ints and a string), and can also have
			// dynamic variables.
			//
			// Stack follows same consistency rules as the .Net VM one. Want similarly computable trustworthiness.
			//
			// Also, our VM should be a thin decorator on top of the .Net VM. That gives us easy port to .Net & Mono, and should be re-implementable
			// on LLVM for other platforms (if necessary, eventually).
